- `visualizations/`: Contains visualization outputs.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run the ETL scripts to prepare the data.
3. Perform EDA using the provided notebooks.
4. Execute Spark jobs for parallel processing.
5. Monitor job performance using Databricks.
6. Store data in HDFS and track job metrics.

## How to Run
